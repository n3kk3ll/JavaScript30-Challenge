# JavaScript30-Challenge
Accepted a challenge to build 30 things in 30 days with only Vanilla JavaScript. All my progress will be displayed here. One day - one new project!

## Day 01 - Drum Kit
Things I learned and practiced today:
* Keyboard events ("keydown" mostly)
* Transition events (to remove activity class only when transition has ended)
* HTML data-attributes (refreshed my memory how to use it)

## Day 02 - Clock
Today I worked with Date() object. The clock I created is synchronized with user's PC clock. Also spotted a glitch, when second hand does full round, it glitches because of transition property. I handled it by using if statement, when hand is about to do full round, i remove transition to make that glitch disappear.

# JavaScript30-Challenge
Accepted a challenge to build 30 things in 30 days with only Vanilla JavaScript. All my progress will be displayed here. One day - one new project!

## Day 01 - Drum Kit
Things I learned and practiced today:
* Keyboard events ("keydown" mostly)
* Transition events (to remove activity class only when transition has ended)
* HTML data-attributes (refreshed my memory how to use it)
